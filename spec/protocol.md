title: FBP Network Protocol
layout: documentation
---
The Flow-Based Programming network protocol (*FBP protocol*) has been designed primarily for flow-based programming interfaces like the [NoFlo UI](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noflo/noflo-development-environment) to communicate with various FBP runtimes. However, it can also be utilized for communication between different runtimes, for example server-to-server or server-to-microcontroller.

## Basics

The FBP protocol is a message-based protocol that can be handled using various different transport mechanisms. The messages are designed to be independent, and not to form a request-response cycle in order to allow highly asynchronous operations and situations where multiple protocol clients talk with the same runtime.

There are currently three transports utilized commonly:

* [Web Messaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Messaging) (`postMessage`) for communication between different web pages or WebWorkers running inside the same browser instance
* [WebSocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) for communicating between a browser and a server, or between two server instances
* [WebRTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) for peer-to-peer communications between a runtime and a client

Different transports can be utilized as needed. It could be interesting to implement the FBP protocol using [MQTT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQ_Telemetry_Transport), for instance.

### Sub-protocols

The FBP protocol is divided into four sub-protocols, or "channels":

* `runtime`: communications about runtime capabilities and its exported ports
* `graph`: communications about graph changes
* `component`: communications about available components and changes to them
* `network`: communications related to running a FBP graph
* `trace`: communications related to tracing a FBP network

### Message structure

This document describes all messages as the data structures that are passed. The way these are encoded depends on the transport being used. For example, with WebSockets all messages are encoded as stringified JSON.

All messages consist of three parts:

* Sub-protocol identifier (`graph`, `component`, or `network`)
* Topic (for example, `addnode`)
* Message payload (typically a data structure specific to the sub-protocol and topic)

The keys listed in specific messages are for the message payloads. The values are strings unless stated differently.

<a id="runtime"></a>
## Runtime protocol

When a client connects to a FBP procotol it may choose to discover the capabilities and other information about the runtime.

### `getruntime`

Request the information about the runtime. When receiving this message the runtime should response with a `runtime` message.

* `secret`: access token to authorize the user

Runtimes can handle access control by limiting capabilities based on the received token.

### `runtime`

Response from the runtime to the `getruntime` request.

* `type`: type of the runtime, for example `noflo-nodejs` or `microflo`
* `version`: version of the runtime protocol that the runtime supports, for example `0.5`
* `capabilities`: array of capability strings for things the runtime allows the user to do
* `allCapabilities`: array of capability strings for things the runtime is able to do. May include things not permitted for the user
* `id`: (optional) runtime ID used with [Flowhub Registry](http://flowhub.io)
* `label`: (optional) Human-readable description of the runtime
* `graph`: (optional) ID of the currently configured main graph running on the runtime, if any

Current list of capabilities understood by runtimes and clients include:

* `protocol:runtime`: the runtime is able to expose the ports of its main graph using the [Runtime protocol](#runtime) and transmit packet information to/from them
* `protocol:graph`: the runtime is able to modify its graphs using the [Graph protocol](#graph)
* `protocol:component`: the runtime is able to list and modify its components using the [Component protocol](#component)
* `protocol:network`: the runtime is able to control and introspect its running networks using the [Network protocol](#network)
* `protocol:trace`: the runtime is able to trace its running networks using the [Trace protocol](#trace)
* `component:setsource`: runtime is able to compile and run custom components sent as source code strings
* `component:getsource`: runtime is able to read and send component source code back to client
* `network:persist`: runtime is able to "flash" a running graph setup into itself, making it persistent across reboots

If the runtime is currently running a graph and it is able to speak the full [Runtime protocol](#runtime), it should follow up with a `ports` message.

### `ports`

Message sent by the runtime to signal the exported ports. The runtime is responsible for sending the up-to-date list of available ports back to client whenever it changes. Should be sent for all started networks.

* `graph`: ID of graph these ports belong to
* `inPorts`: list of input ports, each containing:
  - `id`: port name
  - `type`: port datatype, for example `boolean`
  - `description`: textual description of the port
  - `addressable`: boolean telling whether the port is an ArrayPort
  - `required`: boolean telling whether the port needs to be connected for the component to work
* `outPorts`: list of output ports, each containing:
  - `id`: port name
  - `type`: port datatype, for example `boolean`
  - `description`: textual description of the port
  - `addressable`: boolean telling whether the port is an ArrayPort
  - `required`: boolean telling whether the port needs to be connected for the component to work

### `packet`

Runtimes that can be used as remote subgraphs (i.e. ones that have reported supporting the `protocol:runtime` capability) need to be able to receive and transmit information packets at their exposed ports.

These packets can be send from the client to the runtime's input ports, or from runtime's output ports to the client.

* `port`: port name for the input or output port
* `event`: packet event, one of `connect`, `begingroup`, `data`, `endgroup`, and `disconnect`
* `payload`: (optional) payload for the packet. Used only with `begingroup` (for group names) and `data` packets
* `graph`: graph the action targets
* `secret`: access token to authorize the user

<a id="graph"></a>
## Graph protocol

This protocol is utilized for communicating about graph changes in both directions.

### `clear`

Initialize an empty graph.

* `id`: identifier for the graph being created. Used for all subsequent messages related to the graph instance
* `name`: (optional) Human-readable label for the graph

* `icon`: (optional) Icon to use for the graph when used as a component
* `description`: (optional) Description to use for the graph when used as a component
* `secret`: access token to authorize the user

Graphs registered in this way should also be available for use as subgraphs in other graphs. Therefore a graph registration and later changes to it may cause `component` messages of the [Component protocol](#component) to be sent back to the client informing of possible changes in the ports of the subgraph component.
