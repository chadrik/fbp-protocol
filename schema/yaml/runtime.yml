      Runtimes that can be used as remote subgraphs (i.e. ones that have
      reported supporting the protocol:runtime capability) need to be able to
      receive and transmit information packets at their exposed ports.

      These packets can be send from the client to the runtimes input ports, or from
      runtimes output ports to the client.
